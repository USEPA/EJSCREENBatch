Description: This package is a wrapper for EJSCREEN, created to allows users to 
             perform batch screening for water-related environmental justice purposes.
             Users can perform either a land-based screening to screen locations 
             with circular buffers around those locations. Users can also 
             perform explicit water-based screening, examining areas within a buffer area 
             of known waterbody features (e.g., stream, river, etc...).
