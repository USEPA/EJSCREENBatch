Description: This package is an R wrapper for use of EPA's EJSCREEN data, created to perform batch environmental justice screening, with a particular emphasis on water-based screening. Users can perform standard land-based proximity analysis using circular buffers or user designated polygons. Users can also perform explicit water-based proximity screening, examining areas within a buffer of known waterbody features (e.g., streams, rivers, etc...).
