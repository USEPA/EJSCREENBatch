# EJSCREENbatch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

As of 8/18/2023 Version 2.0.1 is now available! This version has simplified EJfunction()'s input requirements and deprecated several secondary data visualization functions.

To streamline initial EJ analysis efforts over *multiple locations of interest*, the EJSCREENbatch R package was developed to leverage the national demographic and environmental datasets made available through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

This package offers canned functions to extract and process Census block group EJSCREEN and ACS data for buffered areas surrounding user-provided [sf geographies](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). Users can request different buffer distances or GIS inclusion methods. Moreover, buffers can be distance-based over land (i.e. drawing circles around lat/longs) or water (leveraging the [NHDPlus network](https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/) to measure up/downstream).

A secondary interactive mapping function, useful for preliminary analytical exploration, is also included.

## Installation

You can install EJSCREENbatch from GitHub with the following:

```{r, eval = F}
# requires devtools to install
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

# install from repository
install_github('USEPA/EJSCREENbatch')
library(EJSCREENbatch)
```

## Description

Below is a visual overview of the package, highlighting the input types, primary data sources, and examples of output graphics. Three primary data types can be input: coordinates, NHDplus common identifiers (ComIDs), and shape files (linestrings, polygons). The package offers two buffering methods and can accept multiple buffer distances at a time. The user can chose to output summary plots and tables in addition to the returned raw dataframe. Additional documentation and a demonstration on how to leverage the package's functional are available in the vignette directory.
